                    <p>
                        A crucial factor in shaping your strategy, from accumulation and purchases to transfers and ticket issuance,
                        is comprehending how airlines operate in relation to one another and the options available for choosing where to accumulate miles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Airline alliances are groups formed by several airlines that often share the same mileage program.
                        In other words, if you accumulate Avios points, you can transfer these points to other airlines within the same alliance
                        that use these points, or, through the website of one of the airlines, you can book a ticket with another airline
                        from the same alliance, using your accumulated miles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many times, when you search for flights on an airline's website, the results also include flights from other airlines within the same
                        alliance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means you don't necessarily need to stick to a single airline, and you're not limited to relying solely on your country's local
                        carrier.
                        For example, if you live in Germany, you don't have to consider only Lufthansa. With the same miles,
                        you can book a ticket through a much better promotion with TAP or take advantage of a great bonus transfer opportunity
                        to send Livelo points to KLM, for instance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might also need a short-haul flight within Europe, which you can book with a low-cost carrier, spending much less
                        than if you purchased a cash ticket from Lufthansa.
