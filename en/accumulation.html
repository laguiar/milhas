                        This is a topic that demands a lot of planning and time, perhaps the most challenging part of a frequent traveler strategy, 
                        as results come gradually over time.<br />
                        You can for sure devise an efficient miles accumulation strategy; it just requires a bit of dedication and studying the possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>But let's start with the basics of everything.</p>

                    <header class="major">
                        <h2>What are Air Miles?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Miles are a kind of "virtual points" that airlines have been issuing and using for decades.
                        It's a massive business that moves billions per year worldwide.<br />
                        The most basic idea behind miles is to create a bond between the customer and the company, incentivizing you 
                        to consume from that same company again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You know that coffee loyalty card, where you get a free coffee after 10 stamps?<br />
                        The basic concept is similar to miles. The significant difference is that miles are traded by companies and can be transferred between
                        partner companies or those belonging to the same group, creating much greater incentives and a massive market around it.
                    </p>

                    <header class="major">
                        <h2>Why do airlines negotiate Miles?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>The main reasons are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To create customer loyalty to the company.</li>
                        <li>When you buy Miles, the company receives the paid amount as an "advance" for the tickets you will issue in the future, which might
                            not even be issued. Hence, discounts on mile sales are possible.</li>
                        <li>When you purchase a ticket and pay with a credit card, the company will receive that amount weeks later, sometimes even 60 days
                            later. Thus, there's no incentive for the airline to sell you tickets in cash.</li>
                        <li>It's possible to use Miles for upgrades, purchase other services, and consume during the flight, making it beneficial for the
                            company that you have miles.</li>
                        <li>Every sold Mile is money the airline earned without you having consumed anything.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Platforms to buy Miles in Europe/North America are not covered yet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Pay close attention to the expiration date of your miles. Generally, they can be valid for between 2 and 3 years, but especially
                                promotional miles might have a much shorter validity period.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Which airlines to accumulate miles with?</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Although there is a lot of information online suggesting to accumulate miles with a single airline, <strong>do NOT</strong> do that.
                        It's crucial to understand <a href="airline-alliances.html" target="_blank">airline alliances</a>, formed by multiple airlines together, partnerships, and
                        the possibilities of transferring miles between them.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you live in Europe, in particular, another common mistake is to focus solely on your country's main airline.</p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you live in the Netherlands 🇳🇱, KLM is excellent and has routes all over the world. But by using various tools to
                        accumulate miles, you can probably find much better deals, sometimes in <strong>Business Class</strong>, to fly with Iberia departing
                        from Madrid 🇪🇸 or TAP departing from Lisbon 🇵🇹, cheaper than the same economy class route with KLM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Study and understand the airlines, their alliances, and partnerships well before focusing everything on a single company.
                        Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
                    </p>

                        <h2>How to Accumulate Miles</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Here is where everyone needs to study their local options and create a strategy based on the available choices.<br />
                        As mentioned, it's important to know in which frequent flyer programs it's most advantageous to accumulate miles, so read in detail
                        about <a href="airline-alliances.html" target="_blank">airline alliances</a> and partnerships.
                    </p>
                    <p>The most common ways to accumulate miles are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flying and earning miles per segment/flight</li>
                        <li>Booking hotels in chains that offer points/miles</li>
                        <li>Credit Cards (dedicated section)</li>
                        <li>Shopping online using links/coupons from loyalty programs</li>
                        <li>Renting cars from chains that offer points/miles</li>
                        <li>Fueling your car at gas stations that offer points/miles</li>
                        <li>Supermarket points and cashback programs, very common in various countries</li>
                        <li>Purchasing miles <i>(within the ceiling limit)</i></li>
                        <li>Bonus point transfers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Although this is repeated in other sections, it's worth emphasizing that when creating accounts on hotel platforms, car rental
                        companies, etc., you need to use the <strong>SAME NAME</strong> on all accounts. Many of these platforms only allow point transfers
                        between accounts with the same name/last name.
                    </blockquote>

                    <header class="major">
                        <h2>Hotel Reservations</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        Major hotel groups often have partnerships with several airlines, and you can accumulate miles by booking hotels through airline
                        websites or the hotel network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Almost all loyalty and cashback programs have partnerships with hotel chains <i>(examples in the section below)</i>. They also have their
                        loyalty programs where you can accumulate points and convert them to miles. These points can also be transferred with bonuses to other
                        airlines.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Always remember to use <strong>the same name/last name</strong> and email on all accounts to transfer points between them.

                    <h3>Using accommodation portals</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        <span class="image right"><img src="images/ba-airbnb.png" alt="" data-position="top center" /></span>
                        For sure the most common way to reserve accommodation is to use big portals like Booking and AirBnb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The hint here, again, is the same to everything miles and points related: <strong>never go straight to the website 
                            of the service you want to use!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: through the British Executive Club website, you accumulate <strong>Avios</strong> using AirBnb, 
                        you just have to start the session via the Executive Club website instead of going straight to AirBnb.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same goes for the portal <a href="https://www.booking.com" target="_blank">Booking.com</a>, many loyalty programs 
                        and airlines have partnerships with Booking, all you have to do is enter the travel portal of the program and 
                        use Booking from there.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Points Programs and Online Stores</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        <span class="image left"><img src="../images/payback-card.png" alt="" /></span>
                        There are various platforms that generate their points, similar to hotel chains, or cashbacks, that can be converted into miles. Each
                        country has its options, and often the loyalty programs themselves have partnerships and online stores for booking hotels, renting
                        cars, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In many countries, this even happens with supermarket chains, where loyalty cards generate points and discounts, and many of them have
                        partnerships with airlines, and the points can be converted to miles.<br />
                        Check if you already use a supermarket or large retail store's loyalty card in your country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An extremely crucial tool to use is partnership links, <strong>bonus links</strong>. You visit your loyalty program's website, and
                        through it, you'll find links that direct you to other online stores, like Amazon, for instance.<br />
                        By making purchases using these links, you directly earn points/miles. Moreover, the points/miles generated by your credit card
                        represent a <strong>double</strong> score. Over 1 or 2 years, you can accumulate a significant number of points using this strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main hint is: <strong>never go straight to the website of the service you want to use!</strong><br />
                        Always use the points programs' portals or airlines, and through the partner links you will be directed
                        to the service you want.
