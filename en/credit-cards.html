                        Credit cards are excellent tools to help you accumulate more miles and even multiply your
                        benefits while traveling. Whether reserving hotels, renting cars, or spending during your trips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A difference many Brazilians encounter in other countries is the lower acceptance and use of credit cards,
                        but there are important tips here to prevent you from losing your card points even in places where
                        usage is more restricted.

                        <h2>Who are Credit Cards for?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        The first concept we need to establish here is that there are credit cards for every budget,
                        and all of them can help you significantly, sometimes in different areas, but it's always possible
                        to make the most of their benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And no, you don't need to be wealthy and have a huge income to get a card that accumulates points.
                        As a traveler, your focus is to use a credit card that brings you benefits for better and more frequent
                        travels, so focusing on the right things makes a big difference. <br />
                        Accumulating miles will help you much more than gaining access to VIP lounges just for Instagram likes.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>ALWAYS</strong> pay your credit card bill in full. Credit card interest rates are exorbitant and
                        can jeopardize your financial health.
                    </blockquote>

                        When it comes to credit cards with a focus on miles or travel benefits, we can categorize them as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Credit cards issued by airlines.</li>
                        <li>Credit cards issued by banks, with the possibility to earn points in airline programs.</li>
                        <li>Credit cards from <a href="hotel-groups.html" target="_blank">hotel groups</a> that generate points
                            and offer transfers to airline miles.</li>
                        <li>Credit cards issued by major stores, with their own loyalty program,
                            but with partnerships for transferring points to airline miles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Of course, these options greatly depend on your local market, the airlines in your country,
                        and the stores and banks they are partnered with.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        The examples here are mostly focused on Europe, but the concepts are the same for any country.

                        <h2>Insurances</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        An extremely important aspect related to credit cards is the insurance coverage they offer. <br />
                        As a traveler, the last thing you want is to be on the other side of the world and have headaches due
                        to travel-related issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main insurances you should look for in a credit card:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>International Health Insurance</strong>: in case you fall ill or get injured and need
                            medical treatment and/or hospitalization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flight Cancellation Insurance</strong>: if your flight gets canceled and you need to
                            stay longer or even buy a ticket from another airline.
                            Check the total amount covered by the card.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lost Luggage Insurance</strong>: You've arrived in Thailand, but your bags are in Canada.
                            Buying clothes, toiletries, etc., will be reimbursed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Travel Assistance Insurance</strong>: If you need legal assistance, translation services,
                            etc.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Always read all the regulations and rules of your card regarding insurance; the fine print
                        is of utmost importance to understand what to do and what coverage you are entitled to.

                    </header>
                    <p>
                        It might seem like a straightforward task, but here are some additional tips to maximize your card's usage
                        and accumulate even more miles in your daily life:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attempt to put as many of your expenses on your credit card as possible.</li>
                        <li>Register all your online accounts to use your card, or utilize a service like PayPal to centralize all
                            online expenses and add your card as the primary payment method within PayPal or any other platform.</li>
                        <li>PayPal is one of the few payment platforms that accept American Express cards.</li>
                        <li>If you have a low-acceptance Amex card, consider having a second card, like Visa or Mastercard, that also
                            earns miles/points.</li>
                        <li>Research the history of Welcome Bonus promotions for your card; in some cases, it's worthwhile to wait a
                            few months for a new promotion.</li>
                        <li>Refer friends and family who can also benefit from the same card as yours to sign up using your referral
                            link, allowing you to earn referral points.</li>
                        <li>Pay your everyday bills using your credit card (rent, utilities, taxes, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <header class="major">
                        <h3>What's the difference between Welcome Bonus and Referral Bonus?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <span class="image"><img src="../images/miles-and-more-card.png" alt="" /></span>
            
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Welcome Bonus</h3>
                    <p>
                        Also known as the Welcome Bonus, this is a significant offer provided by credit card issuers as an incentive to
                        choose their card over competitors'.<br />
                        These bonuses can include substantial amounts of miles, values to be spent using the card with "no need to
                        pay," access to VIP lounges, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the most attractive aspects is the bonus miles offer, often numbering in the tens of thousands
                        (e.g., 40,000 miles), but occasionally, once or twice a year, companies provide larger promotions with total
                        miles that easily cover a round-trip long-haul flight.<br />
                        You need to keep an eye on the card's website you're interested in and research previous promotions to know
                        what values are usually offered. Note that this type of offer depends on various market conditions and other
                        variables, so it's not a guaranteed occurrence.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Often, this welcome bonus is only credited if you follow certain rules, like not canceling the card for 6
                        months, not missing payments, not having applied for another card from the same company within 18 months, etc.
                        Carefully review the rules of each credit card.<br />
                        The bonus can also be "taken back" if the company detects any suspicious activity solely to receive the bonus.
                    </blockquote>
            
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Referral Bonus</h3>
                    <p>
                        This bonus, also known as a referral bonus, occurs when you share a unique personal link from <strong>your
                            account</strong> with others, allowing them to apply for a card using <strong>YOUR LINK</strong> or your
                        <strong>CODE</strong> during registration.<br />
                        In this way, the company knows you referred a new customer and rewards you with a bonus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In general, referral bonuses are typically a few thousand miles, but in most cases, the quantities are
                        modest. For example, the numbers usually range from 1,000 to 5,000 miles or points, occasionally going over
                        10,000 on cards with higher membership requirements or specific promotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some cards have no limit on how many people you can refer, but they always scrutinize your referrals to
                        ensure there's no fraud to simply earn the bonuses.<br />
                        Other cards might impose a limit on this number, so always check your credit card's rules to know how to
                        proceed and even how to claim points not received due to a referral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some hotel brands and airline programs also offer Referral Bonuses, so always check all the programs you
                        have an account with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In many countries, it's not common to pay bills with a credit card, let alone a debit card. Generally,
                        payments are made through direct debit or conventional bank transfers.<br />
                        It can be challenging to get used to not using any type of card too much, but at least in
                        Europe, this is the norm in many countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An alternative is to try using your credit card to "Top Up" the required amount to pay a bill into a bank
                        account, thus accumulating more points.
                    </p>

                        Never pay a bill as described here if you don't have the money already set aside in your bank account. Don't

                        Be mindful in your use of credit cards.

                        Be especially cautious with <strong>Revolut</strong>, which in some countries doesn't allow you to move the
                        "deposited" money via credit card, like in Singapore 🇸🇬 and Hong Kong 🇭🇰; the funds can only be used for
                        payments made with the Revolut card.

                    <h4>Using some of these tools in practice</h4>
                    <p>

                        Some simple examples to illustrate using Revolut or PayPal in your daily life with credit cards.
                    </p>
                    <strong>1. Paying Bills with Revolut via Bank Transfer:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Within Revolut, go to "Add money" and "deposit" the amount of the bill that needs to be paid, e.g., $100.
                            In this step, your credit card is used, and you'll accumulate points/miles as usual.</li>
                        <li>After the deposit, the amount becomes immediately available for use, so now you simply make a bank transfer
                            using the $100 deposited to pay the bill.</li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <strong>2. Scheduled Payments via Revolut:</strong>
                    <p>Slight variation of example 1, in a scenario where you pay 2000 € Euros in bills every month:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Deposit 2000 € at once into your Revolut account using the credit card.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In transfers, create scheduled transfers for all fixed bills (with fixed amounts) of the month and set them
                            to repeat automatically every month. When the execution date arrives, the account balance will be used.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <strong>3. Paying at Bars/Restaurants with PayPal:</strong>
                    <p>
                        <span class="image left"><img src="../images/paypal-preferences.png" alt="" /></span>
                        PayPal is quite common in North America and some European countries too, so you can find places that accept
                        payments via PayPal but not credit cards.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add your credit card to PayPal and mark it as the primary payment source.</li>
                        <li>In establishments that accept payment/transfer via PayPal, scan the establishment's QR code or manually add
                            the user key to the app and make a PayPal transfer to the establishment's user.</li>
                        <li><strong>Important:</strong> American Express hasn't been awarding points for transfers to send money to
                            friends and family via PayPal. Transactions of a few hundred Euros have been rejected.</li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <strong>4. Paying with Revolut at Places that Only Accept Debit Cards:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Have your Revolut debit card with you or added to Apple/Google Pay.</li>
                        <li>When paying the bill, add the amount to be paid via credit card to your Revolut account.</li>
                        <li>Use the Revolut debit card to pay the bill.</li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <strong>Important:</strong>
