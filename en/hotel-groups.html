                        Similar to airlines, hotel groups also have bilateral partnerships with many airlines.
                        You can transfer points from a hotel chain to book flights with an airline,
                        or use airline points for hotel stays or upgrades.

                    <p>
                        Knowing which hotels belong to which group can help you plan your trips better and accumulate
                        points/miles for future flight bookings.<br />
                        Another option is to use purchased points from platforms like Livelo/Esfera to elevate your status
                        within a hotel group and access various benefits.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        Always check the conversion rate (Points:Miles) for each hotel group and calculate
                        which offers the best value for YOUR usage.

                        Accor Hotels is one of the largest hotel chains in the world, with partnerships with various airlines such as LATAM, TAP, Iberia,
                        Emirates, and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The group comprises various hotel brands, including Ibis, Novotel, Mercure, Sofitel, Pullman, among others.

                    <p>
                        Currently, there's an interesting partnership with AirFrance / KLM, where you can accumulate points in Accor's loyalty program (ALL) and
                        FlyingBlue miles from AirFrance / KLM
                        <strong>simultaneously</strong>, resulting in <strong>double</strong> points. And if you pay with a credit card that also earns points in
                        any program, you effectively generate
                        <strong>TRIPLE POINTS</strong>.

                    <p>

                        Once again, research hotels in the places you frequently travel to or in future destinations you plan to explore. Similar to airlines,
                        always have a backup hotel chain in mind to take advantage of opportunities and maximize your stays and points.
