                    <p>
                        Germany is internationally known for being one of the few developed countries that still primarily uses
                        <i>cash</i> for the vast majority of daily payments.<br />
                        As you may anticipate, credit card usage is not prevalent, even with several available options. 
                        However, these options seldom provide the extensive benefits found in other countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following several weeks of research on this topic, the above table was compiled as a comprehensive visual reference, 
                        solely derived from my travel-focused criteria.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Important criteria for credit card evaluation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Miles / Points Program <i>(or cashback)</i></li>
                        <li>Included travel insurances: Flight cancellation, flight delay, lost baggage,
                            trip cancellation due to illness, coverage for car rentals.</li>
                        <li>Annual fee</li>
                        <li>Foreign currency usage fee</li>
                        <li>Additional benefits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>
                        Pertinent considerations about <a href="https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP"
                            target="_blank">Amex</a> cards:
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The acceptance of Amex in Germany is notably limited, and its prevalence is slightly higher in other European nations; 
                            nevertheless, it remains considerably behind Visa and Mastercard.
                        </li>
                        <li>Having only an Amex card is not viable; having a second card is mandatory.</li>
                        <li>
                            The <strong>Platinum</strong> card undeniably stands as the premier option, and it offers the opportunity to secure 
                            promotions with Welcome Bonuses that essentially offset the expense of an intercontinental journey.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Platinum card's annual fee can be intimidating at first, but there are many benefits and
                            <i>"cash"</i> bonuses that virtually reduce the annual fee's value if you <strong>actually</strong> use most of the bonuses.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you prefer a different Amex card, the <strong>Gold</strong> card has good cost-effectiveness. Alternatively,
                            the <strong>American Express Card</strong>, also known as <strong>Green</strong>,
                            is cheaper than the Gold, with slightly less travel insurance coverage.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="image right"><img src="../../images/payback-card.png" alt="" /></span>
                            I highly recommend everyone to have at least the
                            <a href="https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP" target="_blank">Amex Payback</a> card,
                            which is free.<br />
                            Combining all the possible Payback bonuses with the annual bonus transfer, plus the Amex Max package that doubles the
                            points for every 2 EUR spent,
                            this card is the best option for accumulating points that turn into Miles & More miles.
                            <a href="https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP" target="_blank">[reference link]</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Activate Amex Turbo/Max, an additional paid feature that increases the number of points earned for every 2 EUR spent,
                            significantly improving your points accumulation. <br />
                            Check the current cost for activating this feature on the American Express website, at least for the
                            Amex Payback card, the cost was 30 EUR per year.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Membership RewardsÂ®</strong> program is the foremost advantage and a distinguishing feature that sets American Express 
                        apart from any other Visa or Mastercard offering. That's why it comes with a price. <br />
                        This program offers direct point transfers from Amex to various loyalty programs and hotel networks. There's no other similar
                        option available in Europe. <br />
                        Having this flexibility is crucial for any traveler who wants to choose the best deals and routes, regardless of the airline
                        and loyalty program.

                    <blockquote>
                        If you're considering signing up for any other Amex card besides Payback,
                        <strong>DO NOT</strong> apply for Payback first!<br />
                        You need to wait <strong>18 months</strong> to be eligible for Welcome Bonuses if
                        you already have an Amex card.

                        <span class="image left"><img src="../../images/eurowings-card.png" alt="" /></span>
                        As you can see in the above rating table, the
                        <a href="https://www.barclays.de/kreditkarten/eurowings-premium/" target="_blank">Eurowings Premium</a> card
                        received the highest score in each analyzed category.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It generates Miles & More miles, valid for 36 months, has excellent insurance coverage,
                        on par with the Amex Platinum, has no extra fees for foreign currency usage,
                        and offers a few extra benefits if you ever use Eurowings. The card is issued by Barclays bank,
                        and it's flexible regarding early payments and even interest-free installment options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a slightly less comprehensive insurance package suits you,
                        the <strong>Eurowings Classic</strong> is the best option for generating <strong>Miles & More</strong> miles,
                        with some additional minor benefits. It's cheaper than the Miles & More Card but has the downside of miles expiring every 36
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not necessarily to use the card, but it's highly recommended to have a <strong>Revolut</strong> account
                        to add money using your Visa/Mastercard credit card, earning points as a regular transaction,
                        and using that balance to pay fixed bills through bank transfers <i>(SEPA)</i>, such as rent, utilities, internet, etc.
                        Use the <a href="https://revolut.com/referral/?referral-code=luizegppz" target="_blank">[referral link]</a> to open your
                        account.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Important:</strong>
                    <blockquote>
                        If you plan to use your credit card to Top-Up a Revolut account, forget about the Eurowings cards, since Barclays 
                        bank do not consider transactions on Revolut and Wise, eligible to accrue Miles.

                        <h1>Payback Card</h1>
                    </header>
                    <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/payback-parceiros.png" alt="" /></span>

                    <p>
                        Regardless of the credit card you'll apply for in the future, as recommended above, having a Payback card is truly essential
                        in Germany,
                        I would even say it's essential in any country where Payback operates.<br />
                        Payback has more than 600 partner stores, making it one of the largest points <i>(and discounts)</i> programs in Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Payback points can be converted to <strong>Miles & More</strong> miles at a 1:1 ratio.
                        One of the greatest Payback benefits is the coupons that multiply points earned in each purchase.
                        Since you'll probably use grocery stores, pharmacies, DM, and other affiliated stores and websites like Amazon,
                        not having at least a points card means missing out on accumulating miles <i>"for free"</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="image left"><img src="../../images/miles-more-logo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                        Effectively, the most efficient way to accumulate <strong>Miles & More</strong> miles in Germany is by using:
                        <strong>Payback + Amex Payback Card with Turbo/Max function activated and making the bonus transfers offered by Payback
                        </strong>
                        <i>(do not confuse with automatic transfers that should NOT be used)</i>. <br />
                        This setup is mathematically unbeatable. The downside is that you'll need a second Visa or Mastercard card,
                        mainly for travel insurance benefits and to earn points where Amex cards are not accepted.
                    </p>

                    <p>Payback has two types of cards available in Germany:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Co-branded Cards</strong>: Loyalty cards, only for accumulating points and not used for payments.
                            You can request a Payback card and choose from over 30 Payback partners to be the issuer of your card.
                            Among them, DM, C&A, and Rewe. They work exactly the same; only the card's design differs.

                            If you're planning to apply for an Amex Payback card, keep in mind that It's imperative to observe an 18-month interval 
                            before applying for any other Amex card to be eligible for a full Welcome Bonuses.
                            If you're considering any other Amex card but are still unsure, it's better to wait a bit and not "waste" your Welcome
                            Bonus opportunity by applying for Payback too recently.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The coupons available in the app are almost always personalized and may vary between accounts, so it's common to have
                            coupons in your account that aren't available in others you compare.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have separate accounts for you and your partner and even for children. Since the coupons are individual, having
                            separate accounts will give you a wider variety of available coupons and promotions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Centralize point transfers in a <strong>single</strong> Miles & More account. If you have separate accounts for your family members,
                            the points can be transferred to any Miles & More account, even if the number is provided and doesn't need to be in the same
                            name as the Payback account holder.

                            at the end of the year and sometimes in the middle of the year as well.

                            You can combine subscription service coupons with card benefits like Amex Platinum, which offer refunds for these services
                            up to a certain limit. <i>(check the conditions with Amex before purchasing the coupons)</i>

                            Some large 20x, 30x coupons are available in the Rewe and DM apps directly. Also, keep an eye out for "gift card" coupons
                            from stores you might use in the near future, like Adidas, Apple, Amazon, Aral, etc., which usually offer substantial
                            bonuses.

                            Extra points earned by booking hotels on Booking.com are usually credited only between 40 and 60 days after the checkout
                            date. Be patient to avoid thinking you lost your points.
