# Credit Cards

<img alt="CartÃ£o amex platinum" src="images/platinum-card.png"/>

Credit cards are great tools to help you earn more miles and even multiply your benefits when traveling.
Whether booking hotels, renting cars or consuming while traveling.


## Who are credit cards for?

The first concept we need to establish here is that there are credit cards for every budget, and they will all help you a lot,
sometimes in different areas, but it is always possible to maximize their benefits.

And no, you don't have to be rich and have a huge income to get a credit card that accumulates points or miles.

> Important: **ALWAYS** pay your invoice 100%, credit card interest is exorbitant and can compromise your financial health.


## What are the most common types of credit cards?

When it comes to cards focusing on miles or travel benefits, we can summarize the cards as follows:

- Cards issued by airlines.
- Cards issued by banks, with the possibility of earning miles in an airline programs.
- Cards issued by banks or large stores, with their own rewards program, but which have a partnership for transferring airline miles.

Obviously these options depend a lot on your local market, which airlines are available in your country and which stores and banks they partner with.

> The examples here are mostly focused on Germany and Europe in general, but the concept is the same in any country.


## How can I accumulate points/miles on my credit card?

It sounds simple, but here are some additional tips to maximize the use of your credit card and earn even more miles.

- Try to accumulate as much of your spending as possible on your card.
- Register all online accounts to use your card, or use something like PayPal to centralize all online spending and add your card as your primary payment method within PayPal.
- PayPal is one of the very few payment platforms that accepts American Express cards.
- If you have an Amex card where the acceptance is low _(looking to you Germany)_, get a second card, Visa or Mastercard, which also generates miles/points.
- Try to search your card's "Welcome Bonus" promotions history, in some cases it is worth waiting a few weeks for a new promotion to get a bigger bonus.
- Indicate friends and family who can also benefit from the same card as yours, to register using your referral link, so you receive the referral points.
- Pay your everyday bills using your credit card.


### What is the difference between Welcome Bonus and Referral Bonus?

<img alt="CartÃ£o Miles & More com bÃ´nus de boas-vindas" src="images/miles-and-more-card.png"/>

- **Welcome Bonus**

This is a very important offer offered by credit card issuers, as a differential so that you choose a card over another from the competition. 
These bonuses can be large amounts of miles, amounts in cash to be consumed using the card and not having to pay, access to VIP rooms, etc.

One of the most interesting points is the offer of _Welcome Miles_, which are usually a few tens of thousands _(40,000 miles for example)_, but eventually, 
once or twice a year, issuers offer greater promotions with total miles which makes it easy to make a long round trip. 

You need to keep an eye on the website of the card you are interested in and search for previous promotions to find out what values are usually offered.

> Important: this welcome bonus is often only credited if you obey certain rules, such as 6 months without canceling the card and not delaying payment, not having signed another card from the same company for 18 months, etc. Carefully check the rules for each credit card.


- **Referral Bonus**

This bonus happens when you share a unique link to your account with others so that they can apply for a card using **YOUR** link 
or a **CODE** of yours at the time of registration. 
That way, the issuer knows you've referred a new customer and rewards you with a bonus.

Referral bonuses are generally a few thousand miles, but nothing too big. For example, the numbers usually vary between 1,000 and 5,000 miles or points, 
sometimes reaching over 10,000 on some cards or specific promotions.

Some cards have no limit on how many people you can refer, but they always review your referrals to see if there is any type of fraud just to earn bonuses.

Other cards may limit this number, always check your credit card rules to learn how to proceed.

### Tools to pay bills with your credit card and maximize points

In many countries, it is not common to pay bills with a credit card, only direct debit from a bank account or bank transfer.

An alternative is to try to use the card to _"deposit"_ the amount needed to pay a bill, and thus accumulate more points.

> Important: never pay a bill as described here, if you don't already have the money set aside in your bank account, don't make debts on your credit card,
> the interest is exorbitant and will complicate you financially.

- [Revolut](https://revolut.com/referral/?referral-code=luizegppz): accepts _top up_ using credit card. _(fees apply in some countries, check local rules)_
- [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ih/luizg): does not accept Amex cards and you pay fees even on same currency transfers. _(fees apply for credit cards in some countries, check local rules)_
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com): the only platform that accepts Amex cards, no fees for transfers to other PayPal users.
- [PaySend](https://www.paysend.com)
- [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/)

> **Important**: Check the local rules of each of the mentioned services, in some countries not all functionalities
> are available, or fees apply.
>
> Be especially careful with **Revolut**, which in some countries does not allow you to transfer money _"deposited"_ via credit card,
> it can only be used for payments made with the Revolut card.


## Credit Cards in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

<img alt="credit cards scoring table" src="images/credit-card-ratings.png"/>

Germany is known worldwide as one of _(if not the only)_ a very few developed countries where the vast majority os daily payments are made in cash. 
As you can expect, the usage of credit cards is not very common, even tho there are many options available. 

Credit cards in general here, has very few perks a lot when comparing with other countries.

After several weeks researching the topic, the table above was created as a more complete reference, based on
my own totally travel-focused criteria.

Important items in my evaluation criteria:

- Miles or Rewards Program _(or cashback)_
- Travel insurance included: Flight cancellation, flight delay, luggage loss, trip cancellation due to illness, car rental coverage.
- Annuity value
- Additional benefits/perks
- Fees on foreign currency conversion

Some important points regarding **[Amex](https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP)** cards:

- Acceptance in Germany is quite low, although a little better in other European countries, but still not even close to Visa and Mastercard.
- It is not feasible to have only one card if it is Amex, it is mandatory to have a second card _(that also gives rewards/miles)_.
- The Amex **Platinum** card is the best card without a doubt, and it is possible to get some promotions with Welcome Bonus that practically pay for an overseas round trip.
- The annual fee scares, but there are many benefits and _"cash"_ bonuses, which reduce (virtually) the value of the annul fee if you **really** use these bonuses.
- I highly recommend everyone to have at least the [Amex Payback](https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP) card which is free. (please use my [referral link](https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP))

> If you are considering subscribing to any other Amex card other than Payback, **DO NOT** subscribe to Payback first!
>
> You must wait 18 months to be eligible to receive **Welcome Bonuses** if you already have _(or have had)_ an Amex card.


The [Eurowings Premium](https://www.barclays.de/kreditkarten/eurowings-premium/) card was the best scoring overall in my criteria.

It generates **Miles & More** miles, has excellent insurance coverage, similar or slight better than Amex Platinum, has no extra fees for foreign currencies, 
with a few extra benefits if you ever fly with **Eurowings** in your life.

If a slightly less complete insurance package already suits you, the **Eurowings Classic** is the best option to generate Miles & More miles, with a few extra perks.

Today, my personal setup consists of [Eurowings Premium](https://www.barclays.de/kreditkarten/eurowings-premium/) and
[Amex Payback](https://americanexpress.com/de-de/referral/lUIZGzN8h?XLINK=MYCP), which will be upgraded to another Amex model in the future when a big promotion is in place.
